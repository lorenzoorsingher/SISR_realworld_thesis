\emph{
  First and foremost, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my dad, sister, and, of course, my mom, who proudly claims to be my first CS teacher - though her coding skills might need some debugging! A big shoutout goes to my amazing friends, the lifelong companions who've been there throughout my journey, and the wonderful new friends I've had the pleasure of meeting along the way. Your support has been invaluable to me. Oh, and by the way, to stay on topic, this heartfelt message was AI generated, just in case you were wondering if I'd learned how to be this grateful on my own!
